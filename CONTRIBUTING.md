# Contributing

## Pull Requests

The submission of pull request is somewhat discouraged because the project must remain relatively stable, and changes require thorough consideration. Pull requests for simple issues such as spelling and grammar corrections will be merged without question, but any software related changes should generally be addressed through a bug report or a feature request, unless a pull request is specifically solicited.

## Bug Reports

The submission of bug reports is welcomed where new software related errors are discovered; to provide insight on existing bug reports, simply comment. When submitting a bug report, be sure the pipeline is running inside its container, and provide an example to reproduce the error.

## Feature Requests

The submission of feature requests is welcomed where the pipeline is found to be lacking; to provide insight on existing feature requests, simply comment. When submitting a feature request, just understand the project must remain relatively stable, and it may be rejected promptly.

## User Support

Requests for user support can be made after thoroughly reading documentation and searching through past issues. When requesting user support, be sure the pipeline is running inside its container, and understand support for credential related issues will not be given.
